# Library Management System - OOP Example

This project demonstrates an advanced Python implementation of a **Library Management System** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system manages books and members, allowing for operations such as borrowing and returning books. It showcases key OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and composition.

## Introduction

The Library Management System is a simple application designed to manage a collection of books and a list of members. Members can borrow and return books, and the system keeps track of which books are currently borrowed. This project serves as a practical example of how to design and implement a system using OOP principles in Python.

## Features

- **Abstract Base Class (`Person`)**: Defines a common interface for all persons in the system.
- **Inheritance**: The `Member` class inherits from the `Person` class and extends its functionality.
- **Encapsulation**: Private attributes are used to protect sensitive data and control access.
- **Polymorphism**: Methods with the same name can behave differently depending on the object that invokes them.
- **Composition**: The `Library` class manages collections of `Book` and `Member` objects.
- **Book Management**: Add, list, borrow, and return books.
- **Member Management**: Add members, list members, and manage their borrowed books.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Install Required Packages

No external packages are required for this project.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

   Go to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd library-management-system
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:

   Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python library_management_system.py
   ```

### Running the Program

When you run the script, it will:

- Create a library and add a few books and members.
- Perform various operations like borrowing and returning books.
- Display the list of books and members before and after operations.

## Examples

### Output

Running the script will produce output similar to:

```
Added book: The Great Gatsby.
Added book: To Kill a Mockingbird.
Added book: 1984.
Added member: Alice Johnson.
Added member: Bob Smith.

Title: 1984, Author: George Orwell, ISBN: 9780451524935
```

### Extending the System

To extend the system, you can:

- **Add more features**: Implement more functionality like reserving books, tracking due dates, or generating reports.
- **Create new types of users**: Implement different types of members (e.g., students, faculty) with specific rules.
- **Enhance the UI**: Develop a command-line or graphical interface to interact with the system.
